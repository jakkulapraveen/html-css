            The <span class="unity-link">unity</span> Game Designer Playbook aims to inspire and instruct game designers
            who want to learn how to prototype, craft, and test gameplay in Unity. Whether
            you study game design, are starting out in your career, or have years of
            professional experience, you can reference this guide as you begin to add Unity
            skills to your profile.
            Unity is the most widely used game development platform, so gaining Unity
            skills can open up new opportunities for you, even if you work on a team using
            another engine.
            The contributors to this guide are game designers both within Unity and from
            our community. The content reflects their vibrant creativity, advanced expertise,
            and unique mix of skills and interests.
            Youâ€™ll find a broad, even eclectic, mix of detailed introductions to Unity tool sets,
            instructional sections that you can follow in your own project, and a wide variety
            of examples that illustrate how to create and juice up gameplay in Unity.
            Some of the topics covered include Editor navigation and beginner C# scripting
            concepts, visual scripting, creating input, setting up character controllers,
            greyboxing and level-design tools, cinematics, microinteractions and
            randomization, special effects, and more.
